# MPLS Tunneling with gns3

This simple application consists in the implementation of MPLS tunneling and Quality of Service policies in a simulated network (more details in the documentation). It can be imported in the gns3 software for testing. 
This project was developed for the Advanced Networks & Wireless Systems course (MsC in Computer Engineering @ University of Pisa) in collaboration with G. Alvaro and L. Fontanelli.
